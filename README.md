# QAssist

**QAssist** is a mobile application for digitalization and gamification of clinical trial questionnaires. It makes the process of participating in clinical trials more fun and engaging for the participants by taking a game-in-game approach. For the organizers of clinical studies, it allows collection of more objective and accurate data. 

In the current prototype, a participant can:
* specify her symptoms using the `Checkup` button,
* take one of the several tests by playing mini-games.

Each mini-game plays out a simple test to measure a value, e.g., reaction time, vision, etc. 

QAssist was developed during the [HPI Startup Bootcamp 2018](https://hpi.de/entrepreneurship/veranstaltungen/startup-bootcamps/hpi-startup-bootcamp-2018.html).
