# QAssist

**QAssist* is a mobile application for digitalization and gamification of clinical trial questionnaires. It makes the process of participating in clinical trials more fun and engaging for the participants by taking a game-in-game approach. For the organizers of clinical studies, it allows collection of more objective and accurate data. 

A participant can specify her symptoms using the 'Checkup' button or take one of the several tests by playing mini-games.

QAssist was developed during the HPI Startup Bootcamp 2018.
